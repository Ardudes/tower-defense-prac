# tower-defense-prac
Attempt at making a tower defense game using Pyxel and Python.

- Code structure: MVC, but split by feature (each feature has its own model, view, and controller)

TODO:
- How will the map be represented in terms of data structures? I'm currently thinking of just using a 2D matrix made of arrays.
- Storing a map

PLANNED FEATURES:

Misc:
- Tutorial
- Settings
- Saves

Game Mechanics:
- Pathfinding (done, used BFS)
- Towers (...)
- Damage calculation (...)
- End State (Victory? Endless?)
- Map-maker (WIP)

Controls:
- Camera Movement (use camera())
- Menus (just draw them last so they go on top)
